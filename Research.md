"[Firms of a Feather Merge Together: Cultural Proximity and M&A Outcomes](/_uploads/mna_paper.pdf)” with [Manaswini Bhalla](https://manaswinibhalla.weebly.com/), [Manisha Goel](http://manishagoel.weebly.com/) and [Michelle Zemel](https://research.pomona.edu/michelle-zemel/)

**Abstract:** 

Using data from India, we show that shared caste identities between two firms’ directors increase the likelihood of entering a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal. This may indicate directors’ reliance on caste as an informal information channel. But it may also be driven by their agency or overestimating synergies, leading to suboptimal deals. Indeed, we find that caste-proximate M&A deals create less value than caste-distant deals for both acquirer and target. The negotiation process and long-run performance also do not improve. Evidence strongly supports the presence of agency costs but not information gains or overestimation of synergies.
