"[Forecasting Macroeconomic Variables: A Systematic Comparison of Machine Learning Methods](/uploads/jmp_20240716.pdf)” with [Qian Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qian-li-147a40b3)

**Abstract:** 

This paper evaluates the performance of an extensive set of machine learning algorithms in forecasting macroeconomic variables relative to baseline econometric models. We conduct a pseudo-out-of-sample forecast for fifteen real, nominal, and financial variables. The findings can be summarized in three points. First, machine learning models perform better than the benchmark model in forecasting real variables but worse than the baseline models in forecasting nominal variables (price indices) and financial variables. Second, machine learning models forecast better than benchmark models during periods of high volatility, like recessions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, models that employ dimension reduction frequently appear in the top five most accurate models in forecasting real variables, especially at longer horizons.

"[Firms of a Feather Merge Together: Cultural Proximity and M&A Outcomes](/uploads/mna_paper.pdf)” with [Manaswini Bhalla](https://manaswinibhalla.weebly.com/), [Manisha Goel](http://manishagoel.weebly.com/) and [Michelle Zemel](https://research.pomona.edu/michelle-zemel/)

**Abstract:** 

Using data from India, we show that shared caste identities between two firms’ directors increase the likelihood of entering a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal. This may indicate directors’ reliance on caste as an informal information channel. But it may also be driven by their agency or overestimating synergies, leading to suboptimal deals. Indeed, we find that caste-proximate M&A deals create less value than caste-distant deals for both acquirer and target. The negotiation process and long-run performance also do not improve. Evidence strongly supports the presence of agency costs but not information gains or overestimation of synergies.
