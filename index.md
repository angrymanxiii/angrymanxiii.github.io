I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Economics Department](https://economics.nd.edu) at the University of Notre Dame. My primary research interests include Applied Macroeconometrics, Time Series, and Machine Learning Forecasting. [Christiane Baumeister](https://sites.google.com/site/cjsbaumeister/home) is my Ph.D. advisor. I interned at Amazon in the summer of 2023 as an Economist in their Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) org.
