I am an Economist at the [Michigan Department of Treasury](https://www.michigan.gov/treasury), where I work on tax policy analysis and revenue forecasting, with a focus on corporate income taxation and fiscal policy.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://economics.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) in June 2024. My primary research interests include Applied Macroeconometrics, Time Series, and Forecasting using Machine Learning Methods. [Christiane Baumeister](https://sites.google.com/site/cjsbaumeister/home) was my Ph.D. advisor. I interned as an Economist at Amazon Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) in the summer of 2023.
